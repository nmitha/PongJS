# PongJS

Don't judge me too harshly on this code, it was basically my first time writing JS beyond basic jQuery stuff.

You play yourself at pong and try to stay alive as long as you can.  Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to control one paddle and up/down for the other paddle.

Collisions aren't debounced, which literally causes bouncing (i.e. occasional insane bouncing at the paddle).  I like it that way.
