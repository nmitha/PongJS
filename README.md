# PongJS

Don't judge me too harshly on this code, it was basically my first time writing JS beyond basic jQuery stuff.

You play yourself at pong and try to stay alive as long as you can.

Collisions aren't debounced, which literally can cause occasional insane bouncing at the paddle.  I like it that way.
